# Create a Token

## Simple Overview of Use/Purpose

This project demonstrates how to create a simple token on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It covers fundamental concepts such as storing token details, minting new tokens, and burning existing tokens.

## Description

You will develop a smart contract named `MyToken` using Solidity 0.8.18. This contract will include public variables for token details, a mapping for balances, a `mint` function to increase the supply, and a `burn` function to decrease it, ensuring sufficient balance before burning.

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Visit the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. No installations are required as Remix is an online IDE.

### Executing Program

1. Open Remix IDE.
2. Create a new file named `MyToken.sol`.
3. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.12 <0.9.0;


contract MyToken {
    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Abhay Tiwari";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "Abhy";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;
    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint(address tokenaddress, uint value) public {
        totalSupply += value;
        balances[tokenaddress] += value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn(address tokenaddress, uint value) public {
        if (balances[tokenaddress] >= value) {
            totalSupply -= value;
            balances[tokenaddress] -= value;
        }
    }
}
```
    

4. Compile the contract by clicking on the "Solidity Compiler" tab and then "Compile MyToken.sol".
5. Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, selecting your contract, and clicking "Deploy".
6. Interact with your deployed contract using the provided interface to call functions like tokenName, tokenAbbr, totalSupply, mint, and burn.

## Help

For common problems or issues:

1. Ensure you have a stable internet connection while using Remix IDE.
2. Make sure the Solidity version in Remix is set to 0.8.18.
3. If you encounter any errors during compilation or deployment, double-check the syntax and version compatibility.

For further assistance, you can refer to the Remix documentation or run the help command within Remix IDE if available.
